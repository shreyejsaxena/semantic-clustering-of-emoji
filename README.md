# Semantic clustering of emoji using OpenAI solutions
Grouping emoji is an interesting data science problem. A lot goes into the semantics of an emoji. 

Using OpenAI's embeddings endpoint and KMeans clustering, we can try to group emoji into semantically similar groups.

Using a call to ChatGPT, we can try to automate the naming of the KMeans clusters. 

The toy notebook in this repo gives an example of how to cluster emoji using OpenAI solutions. 

The csv in this repo shows the results of emoji clustering for K=85 (which may be too low, given there are 5,042 unicode emoji. 

In total, this notebook cost $0.007 to run.
